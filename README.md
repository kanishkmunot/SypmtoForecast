# SymptoForecast: Predicting Diseases Based on Symptoms

SymptoForecast is a healthcare support system that predicts diseases based on symptoms. By using machine learning, SymptoForecast helps users understand potential health conditions and make informed decisions about seeking medical advice.

## What is SymptoForecast?

SymptoForecast uses machine learning to analyze symptoms reported by users and predicts possible diseases or health conditions. It's a quick way for individuals to get an initial idea of their health status and make smarter healthcare choices.

## Key Features

- **Enter Symptoms:** Input your symptoms in a user-friendly way.
- **Disease Prediction:** The system predicts potential diseases based on your symptoms.
- **Quick Insights:** Get fast initial insights into possible health conditions.
- **Learn More:** Alongside predictions, you'll find educational resources about the predicted diseases.

## How It Works

SymptoForecast uses the Random Forest algorithm to predict diseases. This algorithm is great at handling complex relationships in medical data, making it a solid choice for predicting diseases based on symptoms. The algorithm creates many decision trees and combines their predictions for accurate results.

## Our Focus: Improving User Experience

We're currently working on enhancing the user interface for a smoother experience. A user-friendly interface is key to making healthcare decisions more accessible.

## Data Representation

For now, input features are in float type values. We're in the process of refining this to ensure accurate representation and interpretation of symptoms.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your computer:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/symp-to-forecast.git


2. Run the SymptoForecast app:
streamlit run app.py


## Challenges We Faced

Creating SymptoForecast was a rewarding journey, but not without its challenges:

1. **Dataset Collection and Cleaning:** Gathering an accurate symptom-to-disease dataset took time.
2. **Feature Selection:** Choosing the right symptoms for accurate predictions was critical.
3. **Model Complexity:** Building a model that predicts diseases from symptoms required careful development and testing.
4. **Deployment and Design:** Turning the model into a user-friendly web app required teamwork.

WE ARE STILL YET TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT AND ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITIES BUT WE ARE 110% HOPEFUL WE WILL COMPLETE IT SOON ENOUGH!! - HACKSTREET BOYS
